Futsal is a sport that originated in South America in the 1930s and has since become popular around the world. It is similar to soccer, but with some key differences. For instance, futsal is played on a hard surface with a smaller and heavier ball that has less bounce. The game also has different rules, such as no offsides, unlimited substitutions, and shorter halves of 20 minutes each. Futsal requires more skill, speed, and creativity than soccer, as the players have less space and time to maneuver.
